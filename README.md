Spectral/Finite Element library

Simple Python library containing most of the boilerplate you need in order to implement arbitrary [Spectral Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_element_method "Spectral element method") solvers for arbitrary differential equations in simple geometries.

**Disclaimer:** work in progress

## To-do
| Order | Task          | Status        |
|:-----:| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 1     | Upload Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the existing code. | pending |
| 2     | Improve readability and documentation of the meshing code. | pending |
| 3     | Upload extension to multiple dimensions. | pending |
| 4     | Add a notebook demonstrating one of the geometrical mappings (e.g. Gordon-Hall). | pending |
