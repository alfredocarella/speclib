Spectral / Finite Element library

This project will eventually become a free library for implementing arbitrary Spectral or Finite Element solvers (or a combination of both) in a painless way.

To any interested people, please have in mind that this project will receive sporadic attention in my free time. That being said, I accept and encourage any kind of suggestions and I commit myself to answer every e-mail I receive.
