Spectral / Finite Element library

This project will eventually become a free library for implementing arbitrary Spectral or Finite Element solvers (or a combination of both) in a painless way.

To any interested people, please have in mind that this project will receive sporadic attention in my free time. That being said, I accept and encourage any kind of suggestions and I commit myself to answer everyone.


Updates:

2014-02-15. First commit. Work in progress, no functionality yet

2014-04-12. A few classes survived the tests and are working: "Mesh1d", "LSProblem"
            "Iterator" is still preliminar work
            The whole package "speclib" appears to be doing its job very well
